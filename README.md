Please read the information provided within the code. 
Input file should be .txt with data: P error_P T V error_V; with P = pressure V= unit-cell volume and T= temperature. 
Change Z, N, thD0 and T0 depending on the material. Don't forget to adjust the initial models as well as the bounds for the least-squares fit. 
Any feedback will be much appreciated as this is the first version of this programme.
